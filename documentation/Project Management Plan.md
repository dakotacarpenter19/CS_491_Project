## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Project Purpose, Objectives, and Success Criteria
This Project MAnagement Plan is intended to demonstrate the (partial or whole) utter outline of the computer-based game project Checkers, including but not limited to game mechanics, user interface, and user experience. The Project Management Plan list includes all characteristics Chackers will have and others that are crucial to the software.
### 1.2. Project Deliverables
Deliverable: Checkers V1.0 Recipient: Professor Glaue Delivery Date: 3/31/23 Delivery Method: Online distribution
### 1.3. References
Checkers Instructions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers#General_rules
### 1.4. Evolution of the Plan
The evolution of this plan will occur if any unforseen requirements come up in the development cycle. This information will be provided to everyone in the project through scheduled project reviews.
## 2. Project Organization

### 2.1. External Interfaces
Users of the software can contact us via our email addresses for questions.

### 2.2. Internal Structure
Dakota and Austin are both owners of the software. Currently, we do not have specifically defined roles other than project manager which will be defined in the next section.

### 2.3. Roles and Responsibilities
Project Manager (Phase 1) - Dakota Carpenter</br>
Software Lead (Phase 1) - Austin Winters

## 3. Managerial Process Plans

### 3.1. Start-Up Plans

#### 3.1.1 Estimation Plan

#### 3.1.2 Staffing Plan
Two software developers are required for the project. The knowledge of Java is required for the project. 
#### 3.1.3 Staff Training Plan

#### 3.1.5 Project Commitments

### 3.2. Work Plan

### 3.3. Control Plan

#### 3.3.1 Data Control Plan

#### 3.3.2 Requirements Control Plan

#### 3.3.3 Schedule Control Plan

#### 3.3.4 Budget Control Plan

#### 3.3.5 Communication, Tracking, and Reporting Plan

#### 3.3.6 Metrics Collection Plan

### 3.4. Risk Management Plan

### 3.5. Issue Resolution Plan

### 3.6. Project Close-Out Plan

## 4. Technical Process Plan

### 4.1. Process Model
Our software uses an iterative process model. Each phase of the project will represent a new iteration of our software. Phase 1 will focus on project management. Phases 2, 3, and 4 will focus on project implementation, such as software GUI, game state functionality, and deployment, respectively. 

### 4.2. Methods, Tools, and Techniques
Hardware: Desktop or laptop computer with networking to download the game.<br>
Software tools: Java 8+, Eclipse, and Netbeans.<br>
Development methodologies: Our software will be programmed in Java. Our project will be documented with comments in the code as well as in our SRS document.<br>
Quality assurance practices: We will be reviewing each others' code to peer review it. We will test our software by playing the game ourselves as well as by letting people we know play the game. Our software will also utilize JUnit to test things such as moving pieces, capturing pieces, and winning/losing. 

### 4.3. Configuration Management Plan

### 4.4. Quality Assurance Plan

### 4.5. Documentation Plan

### 4.6. Process Improvement Plan
