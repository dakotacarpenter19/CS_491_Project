# **1. Introduction**
## **1.1 Purpose**  
This Software Requirements Specification document is intended to demonstrate the (partial or whole) utter outline of the computer-based game project Checkers, including game mechanics, user interface, and user experience. The SRS list includes all the characteristics Checkers have and those that are crucial to their application. 
## **1.2 Document Conventions**  
There is a disparity between player_1 and player_2. Player 2 can be the character that is being controlled by another person or a CPU player. Whereas player_1 is always an actual person engaging with the game. The SRS documentation printed in Times New Roman font with the normal text size 12 black. 
## **1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions**  
The SRS paper also explains project managers and tests a mechanism to make sure that the game stays true to the original version. The text was prepared in segments and may therefore be viewed as such to fully grasp the project. The overall description for a summary of the document might be viewed in Section 2. The System features provide a thorough explanation of the gaming components and how they relate to each other and can be viewed in Section 3. The additional non-functional requirements outline the technical standards the team will adhere to the project in Section 5.
## **1.4 Project Scope**  
This system's scope is to create a checkers gaming platform using the NetBeans GUI interface. The system will support the game with multiple players including a CPU player. On opposite ends of the gaming board, two opponents play the game of checkers. Players 1 and 2 each have a set of dark and light pieces.  Playerâ€™s switch turns. An opponent's pieces cannot be moved by a player. The support for the fundamental set of features (multiplayer, CPU), as well as the simplicity of developing game comprehension, are advantages of creating this game. This game is available for low-memory devices.
